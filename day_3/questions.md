# Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
###   A conditional statement evaluates some block of ruby to a true or false result then acts on it.
###   Three examples of different conditionals use these operators:"== (equal)", "> (greater than)", and "< (less than)"
1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
###   To test when a condition might be true or false, then act in response to that condition.
1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
###   if (condition)
###      -Do something if true-
###   end -escape block
1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
###   Add "elsif" for other possible known conditions then "else" for a default condition if known are not met.

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement?
###   if (condition)
###      -Do something if true-
###   elsif (additional known condition)
###      -Do something if true-
###   else
###      -Do something if aforementioned conditions are all false-
###   end -escape block

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?
###   Conditionals give us the opportunity to make comparisons of values and statements in addition to "flow control".  These statements are not limited to if-statements.  Comparisons can be used with "case" expressions.  "Case" expressions are multiway "if-statements" with easier and more truncated syntax.
